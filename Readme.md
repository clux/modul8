# Brownie - Bake and glaze web applications

 Brownie is a code and style bundler for browser applications. It aims to compile everything you could possibly need into a two files;
 - a JavaScript bundle that comes with browser-wide require, pulling in shared code in a controlled way
 - a CSS bundle that pulls in your all your imports and can compile from Stylus [css bundler still in heavy development]
 The module system in brownie is inspired by [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), and should indeed be compatible with this,
 but brownie compiles everything in such a way that you won't need to.
 Brownie is implemented with CoffeeScript for [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org).

# version 1.0 almost ready to go!

## Features

  - client-side require (with several code domains as require paths)
  - bundles JavaScript or CoffeeScript
  - bundles classic window exporting libraries
  - compiles CommonJS modules to work with browser require
  - adds 50 lines of javascript to the head of the autogenerated JavaScript file (no extra file to include)
  - enforces modularity best practices (no circular dependencies allowed from the start, and helps analyse your require tree)
  - automatically resolves the require tree and concatenates your required scripts in the right order
  - allows dumping of the prettified require tree for full overview of your code
  - adding extra domains makes sharing code between the server and the client easy (automatically compiled for the browser)
  - pulls in external data to be requirable on the browser if configured.
  - minimizes browser global usage -> attaches you application data to the namespaced `window.(namespace || 'Brownie')`
  - ideal for single page web applications - potentially only 2 HTTP requests to get all your data

## Installation

via npm: coming


## Baking - Compiling scripts

```coffee
brownie = require 'brownie'
brownie.bake
  domains   : [
    ['shared',  dir+'/app/shared/']
    ['client',  dir+'/app/client/']
  ]
  libDir    : dir+'/app/client/lib/'
  libFiles  : ['jquery.js', 'history.js']
  target    : dir+'/public/js/target.js'
  minify    : environment is 'production'
```
### Options

 - `target`         File to write to (must be referenced by your template).
 - `minify`         Pass the the output file through UglifyJS before writing to disk. Defaults to false.
 - `domains`        Array of pairs of form [nameofdomain, pathtodomain] in the order they should be scanned. Think of these as your require paths on the browser. You can define as many/few as you want, but you need at least a 'client' domain.
 We use an array for this interface rather than an object because order may become important. At the moment, all non-client code gets included first, then all the client code.
 - `data`           Object of form key,val == name, pull_fn. This will make the output of the pull_fn requireable on the browser under 'data::name'. Useful for generating dynamic (app specific) data in the targetjs.
 - `basePoint`      Base file where your app is launched. Defaults to 'app.coffee'. It must lie on the 'client' domain.
 - `namespace`      Global object to export everything to. Defaults to 'Brownie'.
 - `libDir`         Directory to find external libraries that you wish to include outside of the require system.
 - `libFiles`       List of files to include in order. Note: libDir+libFiles[i] must exist for all i.
 - `libsOnlyTarget` Optional file to write lib files to. Makes the output of brownie quickly distinguishable from your big libraries, and people won't have to redownload that part of the code everytime you change your app code.
 - `treeTarget`     Where to write the current prettified require tree to. Useful for code analysis. Optional.
 - `logTree`        Boolean to determine if you want the prettified dependency passed to console.log. Default false.
 - `DOMLoadWrap`    Optional function which wraps a code string in a function that executes once the DOMContentLoaded event fires. Defaults to a jQuery wrapper.
 - `localTests`     Bool to determine whether to chuck the standalone module code before bundling/looking for dependencies. Avoids pulling in test dependencies or test code.
 It is a bit raw at the moment, as it indiscriminately chucks everything including the point 'require.main' is referenced in your code. Enable with caution for now.

### Glazing - Compiling stylesheets
In rapid development. The API will look something like this.

```coffee
brownie.glaze
  target : './public/css/target.css'
  minify : environment is 'production'
```
