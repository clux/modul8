<h1>Modularity</h1>

<p>This document contains some basic advice for how to achieve modularity,
then it goes into more advanced ideas as you scroll. At the bottom lie some information on arbiters.</p>

<h2>Welcome to Italy</h2>

<p>It here is one thing you learn quickly in programming, it is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Spaghetti code is awful</li>
</ul>

<p>It is awful to read, but it is even worse to modify or maintain.</p>

<h2>What is Bad Code</h2>

<p>Without rehashing the entire internet: <strong>tightly coupled code is bad code</strong>. Because</p>

<ul>
<li>The more tightly coupled your modules become, the more side-effects alterations will have and the harder it will be to reuse that module (violating DRY)</li>
<li>The more different behaviour per module, the harder it is to to maintain that module.</li>
<li>The more one type of behaviour is spread out into different modules, the harder it is to find the source of that behaviour.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is Good Code</h2>

<h4>What it is not: Bad Code</h4>

<p>If tightly coupled code is bad code, then good code is loosely coupled. A ⇒ B ∴ ¬B ⇒ ¬A.</p>

<p>In other words, if you factor out your behaviour into small separate units of behaviour, you will have gained maintainability and
readibility properties for free, and your code will inevitably have less unknown side-effects, leading to more secure code as well.
It does, however, take certain disipline to constantly police your files for multiple types of behaviour.</p>

<p>You may shrug and say, well, I'm only going to write this once anyway..</p>

<p>..and you will be right. You will write it once and likely wish you wrote it zero times.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the biggest mistake you can make as a learning programmer is to not bothering to factor out behaviour as early as possible.
<em></advice></em></p>

<h2>Best Practices</h2>

<p>modul8 provides the means to separate your code into different files effectively, but how do you as a developer split up your behaviour?</p>

<p>One of the hardest areas to modularize web applications is the client application domain. If you are using jQuery,
you should be particularly familiar with this. <code>$</code> selector calls are spread around, DOM insertion &amp; manipulation code
exists all over the place, identical behaviour modifying functions written for every URL.</p>

<p>If this is problem to you, the first thing you should consider is a MVC/MVVM framework such as Spine/Backbone/Knockout.</p>

<p>Spine is a strongly recommended personal favorite as it is the simplest and the most modular one discovered.</p>

<h3>Decouping MVC code</h3>

<p>How to properly do this depends on the layout of your framework, but here's the gist.</p>

<p><strong>Independent entry controller</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A base point should be some sort of <em>controller</em> which requires all outside controllers</li>
<li>This centralized point should control major events on your site (like going to a new site), delegating to the other main controllers</li>
<li>Nothing should require the main app controller (otherwise you get circulars, keep it simple)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Controllers</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>All other contollers should control events specific to the data type they control</li>
<li>Each controller should have a corresponding model - which the app might not need to know about</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Models</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>This contents of a model may not depend on jQuery (wheras the actual abstract Model class might)</li>
<li>The model should contain logic to get information about this data type (i.e. maybe from one database table via ajax - which should be built in to the base class)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Extras</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Templates should have their own model and controller. The model can store them in LocalStorage or fetch them from server, but they can come bundled with modul8's output as well</li>
<li>Validation logic should exist in the model and should be based on validation rules used on the server - so some data should be passed down to ensure this logic is in sync at all times</li>
<li>Extra HTML helper logic should have its own module (possibly even DOM independent)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Decoupling jQuery code</h3>

<p>For jQuery based applications, some things transcends the framework you use to manage your events.</p>

<p>It is always important to think about the behaviour you are defining. If it is for</p>

<ul>
<li>non-request based DOM interactivity - it is almost always better to write a plugin</li>
<li>request based DOM interactivity - you should use controllers/eventmanagers to handle your events and call above plugins.</li>
<li>calculations needed before DOM manipulation - you should make a standalone calulation module (on a shared domain perhaps) that should work on its own,
and call it at appropriate stages above.</li>
</ul>

<p>This way if something breaks, you should be easily able to narrow down the problem to a UI error, a signaling error, or a calculation error.
⇒ Debugging becomes up to 3 times easier.</p>

<h3>General</h3>

<p>modul8 just tries to facilitate the building of maintainable code. To actually do so, you need to always stay vigilant and remember to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not blend multiple types of behaviour together in one file.</li>
<li>Limit the areas from which you reference global variables.</li>
<li>Look for opportunities to move independent code onto different domains.</li>
<li>Look for opportunities to refactor code to make bits of it independent.</li>
<li>Enforce basic rules of JavaScript modularity: don't try to make circular dependencies work, analyse your require tree.
If you are requiring the same library from every file, chances are you are doing something wrong.</li>
</ul>

<p>Decouple your code this way and you will save yourself the trouble of later having to learn from your mistakes the hard way.</p>

<h2>Going Further</h2>

<h3>Killing Globals</h3>

<p>Global variable are evil, and should be kept to a minimum. We know this, and this is were a require system really shines, but you are generally
going to depend on a few global variables. Not all libraries are CommonJS compliant, and having jQuery plugins showing up in your
dependency tree under every branch that requires jQuery might just make things more confusing than to load them classically.</p>

<p>Besides, you may want to load it in from a separate CDN anyway.</p>

<p>Even in such an environment, it is possible rid yourself of the global <code>$</code> and <code>jQuery</code> symbols without breaking everything.</p>

<p>We will demonstrate such a solution. Begin by constructing a <code>jQuery.js</code> file on your application domain containing:</p>

<pre><code>module.exports = window.jQuery;
delete window.jQuery;
delete window.$
</code></pre>

<p>This means you can use <code>$ = require('jQuery')</code> so everything will be explicitly defined on the application domain,
you've deleted the global shortcuts so that you will know when you forgot to require, and jQuery (but none of its dependencies)
show up in the dependency tree. I.e. you will quickly identify what code is actually DOM dependent, and what isn't or shouldn't be.
Clearly this is advantageous.</p>

<p>Having found this pattern very useful, but also noticing how repeating this pattern on several libraries pollutes our application
code folder with meaningless files, a modul8 extension was created early on to allow automatic creation of these arbiters in the
internal module system by using the <code>arbiters()</code> call.
This example could be automated by chaining on <code>arbiters().add('jQuery', ['jQuery', '$'])</code>. See the <a href="api.html">API docs</a> for more details.</p>

<h3>DOM Dependence</h3>

<p>Note that modul8 only allows one domain to be DOM dependent (the application domain), and from the start you are likely going to have
<code>require('jQuery')</code> in many places there. But if you just find some areas that do not use it, and as a result move logic to an
environment agnostic domain, then it has clearly improved your code enough for me to consider this project a success.</p>

<p>If you can efficiently separate code on the domain level, try to keep above advice in mind -
always aim to factor out behavior into small loosely coupled modules - then you are already
well on your way to resolving spaghetti hell. The rest is getting the correct signaling model for your events to your controllers/controller style entities.</p>

<p>Good luck. Hopefully this is useful on some level.</p>    </div>
